# Project 3: **Didactic Computerr**
*The purpose was to design the architecture of a computer from scratch*\
The project focused on:
* Implementation of the Execution Unity *(registers, ALU)*  
* Implementaiton of the Control Unity 

The emphasise was on the **instruction set** and the **addressing modes** that a computer uses. Therefore, the project has the following functionalities
1. Transfer Data instructions : MOV, PUSH, POP, PUSHF, POPF
2. Arithmetical instructions: ADD, ADC, INC, SUB, SBB, DEC, NEG, CMP
3. Logical and shifting instructions: NOT, AND, OR, XOR, SHL, SHR, SAL, etc
4. Transfer Control instructions: CALL, JMP, JCOND
5. Adressing Modes:
* Direct Mode
* Indirect Mode
* Indexed Addressing
* Immediate Operand, etc

The directory *calc_didactic* contains the code for all the listed items having suggestive names\
The code for the *instruction set* and the *addressing modes* can be found in the *uc.v* file
