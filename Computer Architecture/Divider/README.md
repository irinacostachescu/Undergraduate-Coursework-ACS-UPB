# Project 1: **Divider**

This project required the development of a program which divides two binary numbers with the following assumptions:
* The numbers are **signed integers**
* They are stored using 8 bits in **Two's Complement**
* The given data represents the numerator and the denominator and the result must contain the quotient and the remainder

The approach is based on the *Integer Division (unsigned) with remainder* algorithm

In the following directory you can find:
1. divider.v
* the implementation of the algorithm
2. tester.v
* given test file
