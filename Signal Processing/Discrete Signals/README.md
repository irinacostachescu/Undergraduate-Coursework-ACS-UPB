# Project 1: **Discrete Signals**
*The objective of the project was the introduction of basic concepts regarding the **Signal Processing*** field\
Each directory contains the file/files necessary for solving the proposed tasks:
1. **Tema 1** required the **graphic representation** of the elementary signals 
* Unit impulse function
* Heaviside step function
* Exponential function
* Real sine wave
* Complex sine wave
2. **Tema 2** proposed the development of a function which **discretizes** a given **sinusoidal signal**
3. **Tema 3** is represented by the analysys and the comparison between **periodic** and **aperiodic** sinusoidal signals
4. **Tema 4** fundaments the concept of the **autocorrelation**
5. **Tema 5** demands the use of **randn** function in order to answer the question *Is the function producing a gaussian signal?*

*All the other files found in the directories are given test files used in order to solve the tasks*
