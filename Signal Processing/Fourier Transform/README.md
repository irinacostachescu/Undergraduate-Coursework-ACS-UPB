# Project 1: **Fourier Transform**
*The project consists of different concepts related to the *Fourier Transform*\
Each directory contains the file/files necessary for solving the proposed tasks:
1. **Tema 1** required the **graphic representation** of the **Fourier Transform** of a complex sinusoidal finite signal 
2. **Tema 2** required the analysis of the **spectrum** of a real sinusoidal finite signal and noticing the events that occur
3. **Tema 3**  analysys and the comparison between **periodic** and **aperiodic** sinusoidal signals
4. **Tema 4** fundaments the concept of the **autocorrelation**
5. **Tema 5** demands the use of **randn** function in order to answer the question *Is the function producing a gaussian signal?*
