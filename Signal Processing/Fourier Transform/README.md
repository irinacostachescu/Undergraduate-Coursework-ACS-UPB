# Project 2: **Fourier Transform**
*The project consists of the approaching different concepts related to the **Fourier Transform***\
Each file containing one of the titles is used to solve the given tasks as following:
1. **Task 1** required the **graphic representation** of the **Fourier Transform** of a complex sinusoidal finite signal and the necessary observation about the events that occur 
2. **Task 2** required the analysis of the **spectrum** of a real sinusoidal finite signal and noticing the events that occur. The influence of the phase of the signal on the spectrum was discussed too.
3. **Task 3** reaches the subject of the signal made of the sum of two sinusoidal signals. What happens when they have different amplitudes and very close in value frequencies is a topic also reached and analized 
4. **Task 4** is about the periodicity of a signal and how it can be detected 
5. **Task 5** provides an insight on the concept of **white noise**. Definitions like *periodogram*, *spectral density power* and *dispersion* are explained and used in order to solve the task 

*All the other files are given test files used in order to solve the tasks*
