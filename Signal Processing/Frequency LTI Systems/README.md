# Project 3: **Frequency LTI Systems**
*The project provides an insight on the frequency representaion of **LTI Systems***\
Each directory contains the file/files necessary for solving the proposed tasks:
1. **Tema 1** approached the **FIR** filters as following
* Graphic representation in frequency domain
* How the amplitude of the zeros influences their positions on the unity circle
* How the stability can be analized for discrete time systems
2. **Tema 2** resembles the task from *Tema 1* with the difference that a **2nd order FIR filter** is analized. The differences are graphically illustrated and comented
3. **Tema 3** proposes an autoregressive model. This time it is pointed out an **IIR filter**
4. **Tema 4** requires to create a stable filter and to discuss how the positions of poles and zeros can be *"guessed"* only by taking a look at the **frequency response** 
5. **Tema 5** is about creating a musical instrument considering the following assumptions
* The given sound is a sum of sinusoidal signals
* A filter must be applied in order to alter some frequencies of the given signal
* Now the signal is changed, and its timbre too
* The spectrums of the obtained signals must be sufficiently different in order to notice the phenomenon
